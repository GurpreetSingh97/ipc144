If we don't use an array, we have to declare 10 different variables and it will take too 
much time. However, in case of an array, we have to just declare a single array to store
multiple values.

The advantages of using matching array are:-
1.It can be used to store multiple data of same data type by using just a single name.
2.We ca access any variable easily if we now its index number.
The disadvantages of using matching array are:-
1.We need to know the size of an array in advance.
2.The elements in an array are stored in a consecutive manner.Therefore insertion and
deletion of elements is difficult.

The home portion of workshop was easy. As there was not much of thinking part. However, we 
had to do too many things just in a single code, which made it a little bit confusing.
