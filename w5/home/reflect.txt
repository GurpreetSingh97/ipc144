While dealing with related data, it is better to use a struct array as compared
to parallel array because if we use parallel array we need to create numerous
arrays, which is a time consuming ask and not efficent too. While, if we use
struct array we need to create just a single array, which have the tendency
to store, more than one data in the same box, making it efficent.
The preferred method of declaring a struct data type is in header file because
by doing this our code get stored in more than one file. While we compile more
than one file, the code int the header get copied to all the files, which allow us to edit or modify it at the same spot.
