A C-style string is simply an array of characters but with some aditional
properties. It always ends with a null terminator '\0'. This null terminator
tells the compiler that a char before it was the end of this string. Whereas,
an array of char do not have any special character such as null pointer.


To ensure that the number of input character read by scanf() do not exceed
10 bytes of space that we have allocates for string, we use %10[^\n], which
do not let the scanf to read more than 10 characters.


strcmp(const char*, const char*) return negative number when the first non-
matchin character is before the same indec non-matching number of second string.


If we concatenate "Hello" to "C", we need 7 bytes of memory, 5 for storing 
"Hello", 1 byte for "C" and 1 for null terminator '\0'.
