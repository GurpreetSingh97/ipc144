A function includes a head and a body. The head contains the data type of return's
value, whereas the body contains the instructions of the task it needs to complete.
Functions helps in making the modification or editing of a code easy, as one needs
to make changes in the function only, not in the whole code. Moreover, modularity
help let multiple people work on a certain code at one.

In rental and rental2 code we create addPositive and subtractPositive functions,
making the set of instructions written under them reusable, so we just simply
needs to call them whenever we needed them, avoiding writing the whole code again.

We can send data to a function by passing the values as argument. The value can be
of any data type, it can be a single value or multiple values. We can receive the 
value from function by returning it. We can store this returned value in some variable
or just simply use it.
