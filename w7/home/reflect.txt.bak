In C language the syntax allows the function to return only a single value.
Therefore, when we are required to design a function that can return more than
one value, we pass (receive) values from function through its parameters pointer
that hold the values of variable that receive the multiple return values.

The term deference means getting the value of a variable whose address is saved
in the pointer variable.
Example of deference is :-

	int number =7;       
	int *pi= &number;
	printf("%d",*pi);
 
The address of a variable is stored in a pointer variable.
