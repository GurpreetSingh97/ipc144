The iteration construct used in temps.c in workshop3 are "for" loop and "while". However, there are 3 iteration construct,
in C, the "for" loop, "while" loop and the "do-while" loop. In "while" loop the condition is checked before the execution of the code
written inside the loop. On the Other hand, in "do-while" the condition is checked at the end, after the execution of the code
written inside the loop. Moreover, "do-while" loop runs atleast one time unlike "while" loop.The "if", "else if" and "else" loop are known
as conditional expression. The code inside them, executes if their condition is true.If the condition of both "if" and "else if"
is incorrect then the "else" conditions executes.
