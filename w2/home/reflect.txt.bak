From this workshop I learnt many useful things such as using division and modulas operations in an effective manner.
While calculating the GST we must add 0.005 to value derived,so that we can round of it to the nearest 2 digit decimal place
number. With the help of casting we can convert a variable from one data type to another data type.The modulas 
helps in finding the remainder, in this particular code it was used to find the balance.
