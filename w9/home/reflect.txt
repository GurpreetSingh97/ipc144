The possible return value of readRecord can vary from 0 to 5. The return value 
represents the number of values scanned by the "scanf" function.

Opening a file in "r" gives the permission to only read from the file. On the 
other hand opening a file in "w" gives the permission to only write in the file,
nothing else. Whereas, opening a file in "a+" gives the both permissions, write
data in the file and read something from the file, and it append data in the file
rather than overwrite.

First of all, if the required data is too big, it's better to read from a file
rather than asking the user to enter such a big data.Moreover, if the same data
is required more than once, we can simply read it from file rather than wasting
time every time entering the input.
